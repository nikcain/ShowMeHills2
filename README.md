I wrote [ShowMeHills](https://github.com/ShowMeHills) quite a while ago, but it eventually fell out of favour and I gave it up. However I now live in rural Wales, and all of a sudden want to identify hills around me.

Trying to get the old ShowMeHills didn't work too well with the latest Android Studio, so I've recoded it, and in the process made it a lot easier to use - primarily it doesn't need calibrating any more since the CameraX libraries allow me to get an accurate focal length, and consequently calculate the field of view.
